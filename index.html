<h1>Basic Branching and Merging</h1>

Let’s go through a simple example of branching and merging with a workflow that you might use in the real world. You’ll follow these steps:

Do some work on a website.

Create a branch for a new user story you’re working on.

Do some work in that branch.

At this stage, you’ll receive a call that another issue is critical and you need a hotfix. You’ll do the following:

Switch to your production branch.

Create a branch to add the hotfix.

After it’s tested, merge the hotfix branch, and push to production.

Switch back to your original user story and continue working.

Basic Branching
First, let’s say you’re working on your project and have a couple of commits already on the master branch.

You’ve decided that you’re going to work on issue #53 in whatever issue-tracking system your company uses. To create a new branch and switch to it at the same time, you can run the git checkout command with the -b switch:

$ git checkout -b iss53
Switched to a new branch "iss53"
