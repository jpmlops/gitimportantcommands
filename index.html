    At this point, your project working directory is exactly the way it was
    before you started working on issue #53, and you can concentrate on your
    hotfix. This is an important point to remember: when you switch branches,
    Git resets your working directory to look like it did the last time you
    committed on that branch. It adds, removes, and modifies files automatically
    to make sure your working copy is what the branch looked like on your last
    commit to it. Next, you have a hotfix to make. Let’s create a hotfix branch
    on which to work until it’s completed:
    <pre>
        $ git checkout -b hotfix
        Switched to a new branch 'hotfix'
        $ vim index.html
        $ git commit -a -m 'Fix broken email address'
        [hotfix 1fb7853] Fix broken email address
